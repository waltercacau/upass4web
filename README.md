# Unix Pass for the Web - upass4web


## Introduction

This is a very raw prototype of an offline webapp which allows you
to store and use your GPG keys and encrypted passwords generated by the
unix [pass](http://zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/) utility.

The ideia is to store your GPG key and the encrypted passwords
on localStorage and use it when you need. With the help of a bookmarklet,
you can easily fill password inputs by giving your GPG password
when prompted. This is similar to what you do with services like
[LastPass](lastpass.com).

My initial motivation was to be able to use the passwords generated
by the pass utility with Google Chrome for Android.

I only tested with Google Chrome, but I will try to make compatible with
Firefox and Safari too.
