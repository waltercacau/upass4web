# Unix Pass for the Web - upass4web


## Introduction

This is a very raw prototype of an offline webapp which allows you
to store and use your GPG keys and encrypted passwords generated by the
unix [pass](http://zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/) utility.

The ideia is to store your GPG key and the encrypted passwords
on localStorage and use it when you need. With the help of a bookmarklet,
you can easily fill password inputs by giving your GPG password
when prompted. This is similar to what you do with services like
[LastPass](lastpass.com).

My initial motivation was to be able to use the passwords generated
by the pass utility with Google Chrome for Android. The current implementation
should work with it.

Currently, this app was only tested with Google Chrome, but I will
try to make compatible with Firefox and Safari too.

## How to use


1.  Setup your pass installation

    Follow the instructions:
    http://zx2c4.com/projects/password-store/

    If you don't want to do the setup for trying the app out,
    you can just use the files in the example folder.

2.  Access the app in your browser

    You can pull and run a local webserver:

        git pull https://github.com/waltercacau/upass4web.git
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

    And access it at http://localhost:8080.

    Or you can try the following demo hosted version:

    https://upass4web.appspot.com

    *WARNING*: This is just a demo and not a well tested service.
    Although, the app does not send any information to the server side,
    I cannot guarantee the security of this demo hosted version. So,
    use it at your own risk!

    If you are using the demo hosted version, I highly recommend
    you to use the example files instead of real gpg keys and
    passwords.

3.  Export your test key

    You need to upload keys in armored text, one at a time.
    The following command will allow you to import the keys:

    gpg --export-secret-key -a "yourkeyid or email" > /tmp/mykey.asc

    Or you can just use example/upass4web-key.asc
    Note: The password for the example key is `upass4web` .

4.  Create a test .gpg pass file

    The webapp tries to associate domain names to the file name.
    So, if you upload a file named `upass4web.appspot.com.gpg` ,
    when you

    You can either use pass to generate a file:

        pass generate upass4web.appspot.com 10

    Or you can just use example/upass4web.appspot.com.gpg

5.  Upload your test key file

    Go to the Keys tab and upload the file generated at step 3
    or the example file.

6.  Upload your test pass file

    Go to the Pass tab and upload the file generated at step 3
    or the example file.

7.  Try seeing the contents of the generated test file

    Click on the eye icon near the pass file on the Pass tab.
    You will be asked for a password.

8.  Install the bookmarklet

    The link is shown in the footer. With desktop Chrome you can simply
    drag it to the favorites toolbar.

9.  Try filling a password field

    Use this sample page:

    https://upass4web.appspot.com/password_page_example.html

    Then start the bookmarklet and have fun!


## Known issues

*   Decrypting the passwords is relatively slow. It takes about 2 seconds with my android phone.
